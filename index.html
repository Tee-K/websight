<h1>The Beginnings of New Journey in Life
<P>After several decades of working under the government instituition I have developed many skills in which I could apply in a new career.  
Many might think that starting a new career so late in life is futile, I would have to disagree with all of them.  Yes, one could devote their 
whole life to one thing and make a great impact.  However, God has created us that we are intrict subjects of his creation, with a vast amount
of creativity.  We were designed to be social creatures, to live in harmony with one another.  Even though you could turn on the evening news 
and not think that this is so, that just shows how far we have fallen since the beginning.
<br>
<p>While it may be a quite comfortable to keep myself secluded from the outside world.  Protected from mask-mandators and never-maskers, this 
does not benefit anyone.  In fact, it is easy to see how selfish one can be when they isolate their self in a basement rather than seek to establish 
relationships with other people.  Yes other people can hurt us, but the benefits of having friendship with others not only can build them up,
it also encourage us to not be so self-focused by picking at our own belly button.</p>
<p>The purpose of this page is so that i can learn on my own how to code a website.
<span> And I know there are coding bootcamps out there and there are many programs such as fcc to teach people how to do these things.
<span> I am one of those wierd ones who look at documentation and I like to figure things out on my own.
<span><bold> Not so that I can reinvent the wheel</bold>, rather, I like to keep my busy with learning new and refreshing things.
It is amazing how quickly the mind can become numb when one spends time unwisely, vegitating in front of the old tube.
<br>
<p>So today is the day that I start a new path (even though I did muddle with this in the past) now I think I will begin to take this seriously</p>
